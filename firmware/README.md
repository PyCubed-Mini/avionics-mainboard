Updating from older CircuitPython firmware to 7.2. Put into bootloader mode, copy CURRENT.UF2 from `PYCUBEDBOOT` drive to your computer as a backup. Then update the bootloader by copying [update_bootloader.uf2](https://github.com/spacecraft-design-lab-2019/avionics-motherboard/blob/zac-updates/firmware/pycubedminiv02/update_bootloader.uf2) to the `PYCUBEDBOOT` drive. Board will unmount. BE PATIENT. It will eventually remount to your computer in bootloader mode again. Then copy over [firmware.uf2](https://github.com/spacecraft-design-lab-2019/avionics-motherboard/blob/zac-updates/firmware/pycubedminiv02/firmware.uf2).

Once updated, your pycubedmini.py library will not work.
- TODO: see [flight-software max-fsw branch](https://github.com/spacecraft-design-lab-2019/flight-software/tree/max-fsw/board-side) for updated syntax.
